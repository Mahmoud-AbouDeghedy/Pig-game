# Pig Game

## Overview

Pig Game is a simple, yet fun dice game where players take turns to roll a single die as many times as they wish, or until they roll a 1. The aim of the game is to score 100 points before your opponent does.

## How to Play

Each turn, a player repeatedly rolls a die until either a 1 is rolled or the player decides to "hold":

- If the player rolls a 1, they score nothing and it becomes the next player's turn.
- If the player rolls any other number, it is added to their turn total and the player's turn continues.
- If a player chooses to "hold", their turn total is added to their score, and it becomes the next player's turn.

The first player to score 100 or more points wins.
